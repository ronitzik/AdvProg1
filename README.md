# Multiplayer Game Interface

## Description
This project is an interface for a multiplayer game where several players can join, make moves, and potentially abort the game. The interface provides methods to handle player interactions, including joining the game, making moves, and handling player aborts. It also includes a method to check if the game has ended.

### This is a Java project I completed while taking "Advanced Programming" course.
